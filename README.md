I've always found biomedical engineering fascinating. We live in a world where technology has the capacity to do almost anything that to be faced with impossible is so fustrating. When people lose limbs, they may not be able to grow them back, but engineers work to make robotic aid a reality. The fact that we are at the point that we are now is astonishing and this article serves to highlight that. 

Ian Burkhart severed his spinal cord in 2010. In 2014, a group of researches in Ohio State University placed a small chip in Burkart's brain that they used to monitor electrical signals. But the idea came to neuroscientist Patrick Ganzer, to decode those signals and send them muscles manually. In the end, the system was imperfect but it did give Burkhart more control over his own body. This research represents a big foward in our future ability to restore something lost.
